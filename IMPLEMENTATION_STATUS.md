## 🎯 CURRENT PLAYABILITY STATUS

### ✅ What Works Now
- Launch the game and see a paper plane on the ground
- Drag mouse to aim, release to launch with visual feedback
- Control plane elevation with mouse hold OR keyboard (↑/Space/W)
- Collect yellow rings to restore stamina and increase score
- Track distance traveled and total score
- Game over when plane crashes into ground
- Quick restart with R key or click after game over
- PWA installation on supported browsers

### 📋 Test Instructions
1. Run `npm run dev` 
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Desktop**: Drag to aim → Release to launch → Use ↑/Space/W to elevate
4. **Mobile**: Swipe to aim → Release to launch → Tap/hold to elevate
5. Try to collect rings and see how far you can fly!
