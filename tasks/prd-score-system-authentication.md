# Product Requirements Document: Score System & Authentication

## Introduction/Overview

Enhance Pixel Paper Plane with a comprehensive score management and authentication system that provides players with a personalized gaming experience. The feature will include a start screen, score tracking, user authentication, and a dedicated scores viewing page, all integrated seamlessly with the existing game flow.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, Pixel Paper Plane lacks player retention mechanisms and personalized experiences. Players cannot track their progress over time or compete with others, leading to reduced engagement and replay value.

**Goal**: Create a complete user account and scoring system that transforms the single-session game into a persistent, engaging experience with personal progress tracking and global competition elements.

## Goals

1. **Increase Player Retention**: Provide compelling reasons for players to return through persistent score tracking
2. **Enhance User Experience**: Create a seamless flow from start screen to gameplay to score review
3. **Enable Competition**: Allow players to see their ranking against global leaderboards
4. **Simplify Onboarding**: Implement frictionless guest account creation with optional upgrade path
5. **Ensure Data Persistence**: Maintain score data across sessions and devices through Firebase integration
6. **Improve Game Polish**: Add professional start screen and enhanced game-over experience

- **Typography**: Maintain "Press Start 2P" pixel font for consistency
- **Button Styling**: Follow existing button component patterns with primary/secondary variants
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure all screens work on mobile and desktop devices

### User Experience Flow
```
Start Screen → Game → Game Over → [Login/Home/Scores] → Start Screen
     ↓                              ↑
   Login → Account Creation → Transfer Scores → View Scores
```

### Architecture Requirements
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and Firestore for score storage
- **Local Storage**: Backup system for offline functionality
- **Scene Management**: New Phaser scenes for start and scores screens
- **State Management**: User authentication state across scenes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for network/Firebase issues

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load Firebase only when needed for authentication
- **Caching**: Cache user scores locally for fast access
- **Bundle Size**: Keep authentication dependencies lightweight
- **Offline First**: Prioritize local storage with sync capabilities

### Security Requirements
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and score data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent score manipulation through rapid submissions
- **Data Integrity**: Validate score ranges and prevent impossible values
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection, anonymous guest accounts by default

## Open Questions

### Phase 1 (Current Implementation)
1. Should guest accounts have a visual indicator distinguishing them from full accounts?
2. What should be the exact threshold for prompting account creation (score-based, games-played-based)?
3. Should there be a preview of global leaderboard rankings on the start screen?

### Phase 2 (Future Considerations)
1. How should we handle users who want to delete their accounts and scores?
2. Should there be export functionality for personal score data?
3. What analytics events should we track for product improvement (while respecting privacy)?

### Technical Implementation
1. What should be the Firebase project structure for scalability?
2. How should we handle score validation to prevent cheating?
3. What's the strategy for handling Firebase quota limits as the user base grows?

**Next Steps**: Begin implementation with Phase 1 focusing on core functionality (scenes, local storage, UI) before integrating Firebase authentication and cloud storage.
