## Relevant Files

- `src/scenes/LoginScene.ts` - ‚úÖ Completely redesigned login scene with stable input positioning, simplified UI, and robust authentication flow
- `src/systems/AuthManager.ts` - ‚úÖ Enhanced authentication system with improved error handling, better upgrade flow, and Firebase connection improvements
- `FIREBASE_CONFIG.md` - ‚úÖ Configuration guide verified and compatible with new authentication flow
- `src/scenes/StartScene.ts` - ‚úÖ Start scene that navigates to the improved LoginScene

### Notes

- Input field positioning issues suggest DOM element management problems in Phaser
- Firebase errors indicate configuration or authentication method setup issues
- UI simplification will improve user experience and reduce complexity
- Auto-account creation flow needs proper error handling and user feedback

## Summary of Completed Work

### üîß **Technical Improvements**
1. **Fixed Input Field Positioning**: Replaced unstable CSS manipulation with container-based positioning approach
2. **Simplified UI**: Removed mode switching, toggle buttons, and unnecessary complexity 
3. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**: Implemented auto-account creation with graceful fallbacks
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error messages and proper Firebase connection handling
5. **Better Responsive Design**: Added window resize handling and mobile-friendly behavior

### üé® **UI/UX Enhancements**
- Fixed field positioning between subtitle and CTA button (moved from 35% to 30% screen height)
- Single "SIGN IN" button with simplified flow
- Cleaner form layout with better spacing (button at 50% height, error messages at 60%)
- Improved visual hierarchy and consistent styling
- Enhanced focus states and input styling

### üîê **Authentication Features**
- **Simplified Flow**: Login first ‚Üí auto-create account if needed
- **Smart Upgrade Logic**: Auto-creates guest user if needed before upgrading
- **Better Error Messages**: User-friendly messages for all Firebase error codes
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when Firebase is unavailable
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works with existing Firebase configuration

### üß™ **Testing & Reliability**
- Stable input positioning across screen sizes and browsers
- Robust error handling for network issues and edge cases
- Improved Firebase initialization with retry capability
- End-to-end authentication flow verification
